This folder includes spreadsheets to estimate Diffusivity with Jacobs analytical solution.

The best fit is reached with Solver. 
Go to "Data" and click on Solver.

To fit tide data, enter a dark green cell for "Set Objective" and light green cells for "By Changing Variable Cells". Check "Min" and "Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative" and select GRG Nonlinear for " Select a Solving Method". Finally, click "Solve".

To fit monitoring well data and to estimate D (T/S), enter a dark blue cell to "Set Objective" and a light green cell for "By Changing Variable Cells". Check "Min" and "Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative" and select GRG Nonlinear for " Select a Solving Method". Finally, click "Solve".

The results are in yellow highlited cells. Diffusivity in meters squared per seconds, R-squared for tide and R-squared for well.
